# Hi there, I'm Qais 👋

## About Me 🙋‍♂️

I'm a second-year computer science student at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa, with a strong passion for technology and problem-solving. I'm excited to be pursuing a career in software development.

## Interests 🤔

Apart from programming, I have a few hobbies that I enjoy:

- ⚽ **Soccer:** I am a huge soccer fan and enjoy watching and playing the sport in my free time. I believe that soccer teaches valuable lessons such as teamwork, leadership, and perseverance, which are also important in the field of computer science.

- 💪 **Gym:** I also enjoy going to the gym to stay active and healthy. As a programmer, I spend a lot of time sitting in front of a computer, so it's important for me to take breaks and engage in physical activity. The discipline and dedication required to maintain a regular gym routine also help me in my studies and work.

- 🎮 **Gaming:** When I'm not studying or playing soccer or working out, I enjoy playing video games. I find that gaming provides a fun and interactive way to learn new skills, problem-solve, and exercise my creativity. Some of my favorite games include VALORANT, Apex Legends, and Call of Duty.
