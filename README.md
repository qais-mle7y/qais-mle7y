# Hi there, I'm Qais 👋

## About Me 🙋‍♂️

I'm a third-year computer science student at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa, with a strong passion for technology and problem-solving. I'm excited to be pursuing a career in software development.

## Interests 🤔

Apart from programming, I have a few hobbies that I enjoy:

- ⚽ **Soccer:** I am a huge soccer fan and enjoy watching and playing the sport in my free time. I believe that soccer teaches valuable lessons such as teamwork, leadership, and perseverance, which are also important in the field of computer science.

- 💪 **Gym:** I also enjoy going to the gym to stay active and healthy. As a programmer, I spend a lot of time sitting in front of a computer, so it's important for me to take breaks and engage in physical activity. The discipline and dedication required to maintain a regular gym routine also help me in my studies and work.

- 🎮 **Gaming:** When I'm not studying or playing soccer or working out, I enjoy playing video games. I find that gaming provides a fun and interactive way to learn new skills, problem-solve, and exercise my creativity. Some of my favorite games include VALORANT, Apex Legends, and Call of Duty.

## Skills 💻

I am proficient in the following programming languages:

- ☕ Java
- 🐍 Python
- 🖥️ C++

## Contact 📫

I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and improve my skills, and I'm excited to see where my journey in computer science takes me. If you're interested in connecting with me, feel free to send me a message or check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/qais-mle7y).
